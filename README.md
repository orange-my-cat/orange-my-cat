<h1 align=center> Hello! I'm Ivan.</h1>

A driven, results-oriented student at UWA with a background in data science, mathematics, and statistics. I've also had experience in software and web development.

If you know me, you would know that I love exploring new technologies and using them to solve problems. I'm also the type of guy that spends hours finding how to automate a 10 minute task. I also enjoy scientific programming because they allow me to combine my two favourite subjects, coding and maths. I just love the feeling of solving difficult problems.
