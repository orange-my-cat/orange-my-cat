<h1 align="center"> Hello! I'm Ivan.</h1>

I'm a student studying data science and maths at the University of Western Australia. I'm learning how to code. I love exploring new technologies and using them to solve problems. I'm also the type of guy that spends hours coding to automate a 10 minute task. I also enjoy scientific programming because they challenge me more. I love the feeling of solving difficult problems.
